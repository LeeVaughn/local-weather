# Local Weather App

This application uses geolocation to allow the user to find out the current weather in their local area.

## Motivation

This project was developed as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. You can find more information on the goals for this project in [this fCC post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather). Check out my blog [Regularly Scheduled Programming](https://scheduledprogramming.com/project-local-weather/) to learn more about the story behind developing this project.

## Features

- Displays the current weather in the user's local area along with the expected high and low temperatures
- The user can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius by using a toggle button
- The color scheme and background image changes based on the current weather and weather it is daytime or nighttime

## Future Improvements

- Consider displaying high and low temperatures in a row instead of a column on larger screen sizes

## Built With

- [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/current)
