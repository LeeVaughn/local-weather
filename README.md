# local-weather
This is my take on the Show the Local Weather project for freeCodeCamp.

The app should allow the user to see the weather in their current location. The user should see a different background or icon depending on the weather. The user should be able to push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

To Do List
- display high and low temps as a row instead of column on larger screens.
